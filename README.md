# SudokuSolver
Solves provided Sudoku Puzzles

rows and columns are made of 'box' objects that have an array of int 1-9. as the Solver runs it seeks out the boxes that are solved. It then removes the numbers from the number from the array of the boxes in the same row and col. If the Array in the Box only has one possiblity left (possible.size()==1) the box assigns itself the value of that number. 

Please read the TODO file for things that I have thought of that need done. 
Honestly, I'm open to anything.
